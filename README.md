#Simple MERN Stack shopping card

This is the simple shopping cart project , which is created using mern stack . In this project you can add a product to cart and you can place the order by giving your information.

#Note

1. I used backend and frontend in the same folder, so in the same directory run both server and client.

2. First run server using the command npm run server in the terminal.

3. Next run your client by opening the another terminal by entering the command start from same directory.
